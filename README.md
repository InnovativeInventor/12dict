# 12dict
A few tweaks to the 12dict project by Alan Beale to make it school friendly.

# Blacklist strengths
Light - Removes all obscene words and profanity.

Medium - Removes all negative slang, derogatory phrases, profanity, and references to dangerous items (substances, weapons, etc).

Full - Removes anything remotely controversial, including all references to religion, and everything included in medium. In addition, any word not suitiable for a baby is removed.

# Safedict strengths
Simple has words that an ordinary person would know.
Complex has most words in the English language (not including coined words)
Full is a combination of simple and complex, with repeats taken out.

# Compiling
Clone this project, then just run `bash blacklist.sh` in the dict4schools folder.

# Credits
Too many friends and strangers have helped in the creation of the blacklist to name. 
[tsbuilderboy](https://github.com/tsbuilderboy) added the vast majority of the blacklist words.
