## Origins
This is was created from the 12dict project by Alan Beale and dwyl/english-words. Only blacklisted words were removed.

## Blacklist strengths
Light - Removes all obscene words and profanity.

Medium - Removes all negative slang, derogatory phrases, profanity, and references to dangerous items (substances, weapons, etc). Will not remove words that might be offensive.

Full - Removes anything remotely controversial, including all references to religion, and everything included in medium. In addition, any word not suitiable for a baby is removed. All potentially offensive words are removed. In addition, any offensive-sounding word will be removed.

## Safedict strengths
Simple has words that an ordinary person would know.
Complex has most words in the English language (not including coined words)
Full is a combination of simple and complex, with repeats taken out.

## Compiling
Clone this project, then just run `bash blacklist.sh` in the dict4schools folder.
